when zombies attack mathematical modelling of an outbreak of zombie infection

zombies are a popular figure in pop culture entertainment and they are usually
portrayed as being brought about through an outbreak or epidemic consequently
we model a zombie attack using biological assumptions based on popular zombie
movies we introduce a basic model for zombie infection determine equilibria and
their stability and illustrate the outcome with numerical solutions we then refine the
model to introduce a latent period of zombification whereby humans are infected but
not infectious before becoming undead we then modify the model to include the
effects of possible quarantine or a cure finally we examine the impact of regular
impulsive reductions in the number of zombies and derive conditions under which
eradication can occur we show that only quick aggressive attacks can stave off the
doomsday scenario the collapse of society as zombies overtake us all
